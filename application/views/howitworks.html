  <h1 class="subPageHeader">How Our System Works</h1>
  <p class="howWorkscontent">TripWizard works by generating an itinernary based off several factors about your trip. Follow these simple steps to begin using our service:</p>
  <ol class="howWorkscontent">
    <li>Take the traveler survey for each itinerary you wish to generate. It will ask you what country you are visiting, what city you are visiting, how many days you will be staying there (maximum of 4 days), which hotel you are staying at, the category/categories of sites  you would like to see, and how active you want to be during the dady (determines how much time you will spend sightseeing per day). </li>
    <br>
    <li>Submit the survey and an itinerary will be generated for you based on what you entered. </li>
    <br>
    <li>If you're not a fan of the itinerary that has been generated, you have two options. To keep the number of days, city, busyness, and categories the same, reload the itinerary page. To change any of these, click the "New Survey" button and fill out a new survey. </li>
  </ol>
